King of Calculus Pilot Edition

This game is the culmating project of my computer science class, inspired by Oddrobo's classic King of Math. I made it just for fun. So enjoy :)

Available functions:
- Start a new game (Create new player profile)
- First level of the differentiation chapter (Power Rule)

What's up next:
- Multilanguage support (literally translation)
- Database to store player progress
- More differentiation levels
- *Probably more heros
